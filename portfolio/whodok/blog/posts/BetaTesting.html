<h1 id="title">Beta Testing Pass</h1>
<p id="blurb">If you want to be the first to play our new game,
you need to sign up for a Beta Testing Pass. A Beta Testing 
Pass is Â£3 (or $7) and gives you full access to the game and
all updates. However, if you produce a full and detailed Beta
Testing Report we will send your cash straight back. So think
of it as a deposit, not a charge!</p>
<p>If you are interested in Beta Testing, you need to meet one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Art Student / job involving art</li>
	<li>Able to program</li>
	<li>Regular gamer</li>
	<li>Not a gamer</li>
	<li>Music student / job involving music</li>
	<li>IT Student / job involving IT</li>
	<li>More than three game apps on mobile phone</li>
	<li>No game apps on mobile phone</li>
	<li>Not in possession of a smart phone or Blackberry</li>
</ul>
<p>If you meet those criteria, let us know your name, age, 
professional and criteria you fit in an e-mail to director@whodok.com</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
