<h1 id="title">Abductee Probed by Whodok Team</h1>
<p id="blurb">Chad Meek, who was abducted by aliens, 
joined the Whodok team for a unique Q and A session. He 
received questions about every aspect of his experience 
- people writing the story and designing the graphics 
for our upcoming game benefited massively from the experience.</p>
<p>Michael Mander, CEO of Whodok, commented: "I hope this has been a valuable experience for our team. We want the game to be as realistic as we possibly can and, if aliens are out there, Chad is the man who knows all about them. We'd like to extend our thanks to Chad for the session, who kindly gave up his time to speak to us."
All the questions and answers are below</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do aliens look like?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Aliens can look like you and I. In fact 
if you look at the various seedlings of Humans on 
planet earth from the Indigenous Native Americans,
Aboriginals, Anglo Saxons, Japanese, Eskimos, Anglo 
Saxons you can see that there are many,many different 
brands. Like our Earthly universe one could ostensible 
multiply it by millions. As far as my own experience 
with Aliens that occurred circa 1962-1968 I was abducted 
by the Grays. The grays have large heads, large black 
eyes, thin bodies about 40 KG and are to my memory not 
taller than about 5'6 inches tall. There is an estimate 
of over 200 different types of Aliens but my experience 
was with the Grays. I am convinced that they were given 
License from the Nazi's and was extended to the Eisenhower 
Administration after the war when all of Germany's rocket 
scientists/occultist came to the U.S. There is little other 
explanation for the quantum leap in rocketry and technology 
that the U.S. has enjoyed over the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why were you personally abducted?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I am Jesus Christ incarnate or God 
loved me more then others (joke) . There have been many 
studies on the abduction phenomena. I do not think that 
it is as rare as the government would lead everyone to 
believe. There are some astonishing numbers coming from 
some of the most prestigious institutions in the world 
that estimate it could be in the millions. Once people 
like Dr. John Mack (Harvard) come out with their studies 
they are instantaneously discredited. These are studies 
using the same metrics that are accepted in every other 
discipline. But tie Aliens or something that the 
orthodoxy can't wrap their arms around and it is an 
automatic shout down. There is a paper written by Dr. 
Julian Silverman "Shamans and Acute Schizophrenia" 
(not to be confused with PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA) that 
lead me to believe that I am an older soul that has a 
higher developed Pineal Gland or third eye.
Being around the energy out a Giant Rock (How many 
people do you know played inside a Giant Boulder)hyper 
activated mine. TO MAKE A VERY LONG STORY SHORT I WAS 
ABLE TO SEE AND WITNESS THESE TYPE OF EVENTS THAT OCCUR 
MORE REGULARLY THAN OTHERS.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What forms of technology did you see during your abduction?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> What I remember is being paralyzed 
and levitated/ pulled through a glass window(I shared a 
room with two of my brothers who did not wake up) and 
ended up on a stainless steel table with four Aliens 
telepathically telling me not to worry and that I would 
feel no pain. That's it. I woke up the next morning with 
a very high fever. I was brought to the doctor and recieved 
a shot of penicillin that brought that broke the fever 
after a few hours. I began to st-udder profusely.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What evidence is there that suggests aliens walk among us?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Evidence is problematic. And this 
will try to answer the skeptic question also. I have had 
lived two lives. One as a business man (Materialist) and 
as a Meta-Physician/Spiritualist. I hold the record for 
oil wells that were drilled in the State of Nevada in a 
given year. I was running a Science based team that included 
Geophysicist and Geologist conducting every conceivable 
geophysical study that you could do at the time that included 
Soil Geochemistry, 2D Seismic/Swath. We hit three dry holes 
in a row. I finally brought out a "witcher" and picked the 
next well location. My staff was not happy and disagreed with 
our location and the non scientific method that we took. 
We made a discovery well out in the middle of nowhere.
Why did that work and in our case traditional science not 
work? Why ? I simply don't know. 
How or why come that Astronauts Cooper, Slayton, White, Cernan, 
Mcdivitt, Loveall, Borman, Armstrong, Aldrin, Carpenter only in 
recent years tell us about their direct experience with UFO's 
and Extraterrestrials? 1. They were threatened to not do that. 
2. If they did their carriers would of been over. Why in a so 
called free society would or could allow this to occur?
Some of the problems with Why questions is that there are 
actually to many reasons and answers that within the context 
of our perception of time would make no sense.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Have you ever met someone you suspected to be an alien?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I personally have ran into a normal 
looking person who knew everything about me that looked human 
but felt like something else.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why would they want to walk among us?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Would you given the opportunity to go 
to Sirius and walk among them do it? I would in a heart beat.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why abduction? Why not e-mail?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It could be a Prime Directive violation. 
In the animal kingdom we have Lions who eat their young. In the 
human condition we have people who consistently break laws like 
the mafia. Perhaps the inability to procreate makes the Grays 
desperate enough to attempt to preserve their species by DNA 
splicing (Adam's rib). As abhorrent as it sounds the Nazi's 
live human experiments along with the ones hat were illegally 
conducted on African American people and U.S. service men made 
great advancements in medicine possible. Who knows what level 
of Science that the grays are at?</p>
