				<p class="left_aligned">
					I used Notepad++ to write my web-pages, and Google Chrome (version: 33.0.1750.154) under Windows 8.1
					as my main testing platform. I also used the following to check cross-browser compatibility:
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p class="left_aligned">Under Windows 8.1 and 7:</p>
				<ul class="left_aligned">
					<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer(versions 5 to current, Using compatibility mode</li>
					<li>Mozilla Firefox (version: 28.0)</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="left_aligned">Under Android 4.3:</p>
				<ul class="left_aligned">
					<li>Google Chrome (version: 33.0.1750.166)</li>
					<li>Android Browser(version: Unknown, Latest)</li>
				</ul>
				<h1 class="left_aligned">My Approach</h1>
				<p class="left_aligned">
					For	this assignment I started off by testing small chunks of HTML and CSS 
					to see how they worked and what sort of result they achieved. Once I was 
					happy with how everything worked, and I had a (sort-of) design goal, I
					began building the index page.
				</p>
				<h2 class="left_aligned">The Header</h2>
				<p class="left_aligned">
					I Began by working on the header part of my page. I initially used drop 
					down menus for navigation, but I decided against those in favour of stylised 
					hyper-links. I tweaked each part of the CSS to make the header display as
					I wanted, and made sure this looked fine across each of my testing browsers.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p class="left_aligned">
					At this point I debated weather or not to use separate files for my header 
					and planned footer. I decided not to, as I thought it would over complicate 
					the end result for me, when I could just copy and paste the relevant code.
					Also, keeping the files separate allowed me to mark the current page with
					an underline very easily.
				</p>
				<h2 class="left_aligned">JavaScript</h2>
				<p class="left_aligned">
					After all this I decided I was ready to try my hand at some JavaScript. I 
					initially had my code in the index.html file, but I moved it out into its own
					main.js file to allow each page to use the same code. While creating this file,
					I messed around with various functions, which lead to the development of the 
					theme picker.
				</p>
				<p class="left_aligned">
					My JavaScript contains my only copied code. These pieces of code were taken
					because I could see no simpler way of doing their job. I made sure to study 
					the code that I copied to understand what each part was doing.
				</p>
				<h2 class="left_aligned">Multiple CSS Files</h2>
				<p class="left_aligned">
					I had the idea for the theme switcher early on, but I left it until the end 
					as it was rather daunting. When I finally started, I realised that it was 
					actually quite easy to achieve. The hardest part of this was the effort 
					required to make each CSS file.
				</p>
				<h2 class="left_aligned">Finishing Up</h2>
				<p class="left_aligned">
					To finalise my assignment, I added in the lastModified JavaScript, the links 
					to the validators and the website favicon, which I got from a free favicon 
					website.
