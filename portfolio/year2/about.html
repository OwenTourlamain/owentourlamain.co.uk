	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Unfortunatley, I ran out of time while doing this assignment, 
	I aimed too high and focused too much on the looks of my website. 
	The rest of this about was written while I was still writing the website.</p>
	<h2>Design</h2>
	<p>Before starting my assignment, I conducted some research on the many online shops that exist on
	the Internet. I focused on music shops shop as iTunes, Amazon and Google Play, for ideas that
	would make my music shop as easy to use and as attractive as theirs. For general functionality of
	my website, I took inspiration from not only different types of online retailers but also from other
	general websites. By doing this, I discovered that by using Google Play and various Microsoft
	pages as inspiration, I would be able to achieve a website, that would not only be functional but
	looks good.</p>
	<p>Before conducting this assignment, I have had previous experience in PHP, as I have made server-side scripted
	websites in the past. As a result of this, I had a decent understanding of how HTML and PHP were
	related and therefore,was pretty confident before making my website. Other modules last year
	enabled me to strengthen my knowledge of HTML and CSS and therefore was already comfortable
	with these. Therefore when starting the website I had a clear vision of what my music shop was
	going to look like and felt comfortable in my ability to be able to do this</p>

	<h1>Evaluation</h1>
	<p>I think that my website does not meet most of the specified requirements, and as such, probably deserves
	a low mark. However I think that the parts of my site that do work, work very well, I think my site looks 
	good and is very user friendly. I think my use of the Itunes API to get the album art is the simplest and most 
	effective way to flesh out the site. Although that feature would have benifited from server-side caching to improve page load times.</p>
